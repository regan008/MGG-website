Mapping the Gay Guides is a collaborative project by Dr. Eric Gonzaba and Dr. Amanda E. Regan. MGG utilizes the Damron Guides, an early but longstanding travel guide aimed at gay men since the early 1960s. An LGBT equivalent to the African American “green books,” the Damron Guides contained lists of bars, bathhouses, cinemas, businesses, hotels, and cruising sites in every U.S. state, where gay men could find friends, companions, and sex.

By associating geographical coordinates with each location mentioned within the Damron Guides, MGG will provide an interface for visualizing the growth of queer spaces in the Southern United States between 1965 and 1980. Mapping the Gay Guides has two components: First, MGG includes an interactive web app that layers digitized data from the Damron Guides to show change over time. Through a series of filters, users will be able to interact with the digitized data from several different entry points including narrowing the data down by city or state, choosing to display only certain categories of establishments, and visualizing change using a date slider.
